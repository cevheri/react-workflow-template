## API Specification â€“ Workflow Purchase Requests

Base URL: `/api/v1`

Conventions
- IDs are opaque strings.
- Dates use ISO 8601 in UTC, e.g., `2024-01-01T09:00:00Z`.
- Pagination: `page` (default 1), `pageSize` (default 20, max 100).
- Standard error shape:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "string",
    "message": "human readable",
    "details": { "optional": "object" }

### Workflow Engine â€“ Business Guide (Finite-State Machine)

This section explains the generic workflow engine from a business perspective, using the finite-state machine (FSM) model. It describes concepts, a step-by-step lifecycle, real-world examples, and practical guidance so anyone reading this document can understand how to define, run, and observe workflows across domains (purchase requests, product specs, projects, etc.).

#### Core Concepts (Business Mapping)
- **WorkflowDefinition**: The template of a process (e.g., PURCHASE_REQUEST_FLOW). It declares the initial state and the set of valid states/transitions.
- **WorkflowState**: A named stage in the process (e.g., DRAFT, SUBMITTED, APPROVED, REJECTED). A workflow instance is always in exactly one state at a time.
- **WorkflowTransition**: A permitted move from one state to another (e.g., Submit: DRAFT â†’ SUBMITTED, Approve: SUBMITTED â†’ APPROVED). Transitions represent business actions.
- **WorkflowInstance**: A running case following a definition, linked to a business entity (e.g., targetType=PURCHASE_REQUEST, targetTypeId=1). Holds current state and context.
- **WorkflowHistory**: The audit trail capturing performed actions, from/to states, who did it, when, and any notes.
- **WorkflowNotification**: Rules for sending notifications when states are entered/exited or transitions complete (email/web/etc.).

#### End-to-End Lifecycle (Step-by-Step)
1) Define the flow template
   - Create a `WorkflowDefinition` (e.g., PURCHASE_REQUEST_FLOW) and pick an `initialStateId`.
2) Configure states
   - Add `WorkflowState` records (e.g., DRAFT, SUBMITTED, APPROVED, REJECTED) under the definition.
3) Configure transitions (business actions)
   - Add `WorkflowTransition` entries (e.g., Submit DRAFTâ†’SUBMITTED, Approve SUBMITTEDâ†’APPROVED, Reject SUBMITTEDâ†’REJECTED). Attach RBAC/business rules in application logic.
4) Create a workflow instance
   - When a business object is created (e.g., PR-001), create a `WorkflowInstance` with `workflowDefinitionId`, `currentStateId=initialStateId`, `targetType`, `targetTypeId`, and rich `context`.
5) Retrieve instance details
   - `GET /api/v1/workflows/instances/{id}/retrieve` returns the current snapshot (definition/state/target/context, timestamps).
6) Discover available actions
   - `GET /api/v1/workflows/instances/{id}/available_actions` lists transitions allowed for the current state and callerâ€™s permissions.
7) Perform a transition
   - `POST /api/v1/workflows/instances/{id}/transitions/{action}` with `{ "transitionId": <id>, "comment": "..." }`. Server validates rules, updates `currentStateId`, and triggers side-effects.
8) Record history
   - Each transition is appended as a `WorkflowHistory` row (fromStateId, toStateId, actionName, notes, createdBy, createdAt).
9) Collaborate with comments
   - `POST /api/v1/workflows/instances/{id}/comments/add` to add notes, decisions, and clarifications.
10) Attach supporting documents
   - `POST /api/v1/workflows/instances/{id}/attachments/add` (multipart) for quotes, approvals, checklists, etc.
11) Notify stakeholders
   - Notification rules (e.g., on Approve) send emails/web messages to recipients (managers, requesters, participants).
12) Report and audit
   - `GET /api/v1/workflows/instances/{id}/histories` provides the full audit trail for compliance and analytics.

#### Real-World Examples
1) Purchase Request (PURCHASE_REQUEST_FLOW)
   - States: DRAFT â†’ SUBMITTED â†’ APPROVED/REJECTED
   - Transitions: Submit (DRAFTâ†’SUBMITTED), Approve (SUBMITTEDâ†’APPROVED), Reject (SUBMITTEDâ†’REJECTED)
   - Sequence:
     1. User creates PR â†’ WorkflowInstance created at DRAFT
     2. User submits â†’ Available action: Submit â†’ Transition â†’ state becomes SUBMITTED
     3. Approver reviews â†’ Actions: Approve or Reject
     4. Decision taken â†’ History recorded, notifications sent
   - Context may include request metadata: number, date, amount, requester, department.

2) Product Specification Review (PRODUCT_SPECIFICATION_FLOW)
   - States: DRAFT â†’ IN_REVIEW â†’ APPROVED/CHANGES_REQUESTED
   - Transitions: SendForReview (DRAFTâ†’IN_REVIEW), Approve (IN_REVIEWâ†’APPROVED), RequestChanges (IN_REVIEWâ†’CHANGES_REQUESTED)
   - Sequence mirrors purchase request, but participants and rules differ (e.g., engineering and QA approval).

3) Project Stage Gate (PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_FLOW)
   - States: INITIATION â†’ PLANNING â†’ EXECUTION â†’ CLOSURE
   - Transitions: StartPlanning, StartExecution, CloseProject
   - Each gate can require documents and approvals; histories and attachments serve audits.

#### Roles, Permissions, and Business Rules
- Available actions depend on both the current state and the callerâ€™s authority/role.
- Business rules can enforce prerequisites (e.g., budget > 0, attachments present, validations passed). If violated, transitions return 409 or 403.
- Notifications keep stakeholders in the loop at critical moments (submission, approval, rejection, completion).

#### Design Recommendations
- Use clear, action-oriented transition names (Approve, Reject, Submit, RequestChanges).
- Keep states mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive for the process.
- Store rich `context` for downstream rules, reporting, and notifications.
- Prefer `transitionId` for execution; accept slugs only if needed.
- Ensure idempotency where appropriate (e.g., guard against double-click Approve).
- Log everything in `WorkflowHistory` for compliance and easy troubleshooting.

#### Why FSM?
Finite-State Machines make complex processes predictable and observable: at any time the instance is in exactly one state; only declared transitions are allowed; histories and notifications offer traceability and engagement. This abstraction scales across domains while keeping the engine generic and the business rules modular.
